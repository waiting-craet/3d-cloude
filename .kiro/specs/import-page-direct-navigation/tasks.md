# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Write bug condition exploration test
  - **Property 1: Fault Condition** - 导入成功延迟跳转问题
  - **CRITICAL**: This test MUST FAIL on unfixed code - failure confirms the bug exists
  - **DO NOT attempt to fix the test or the code when it fails**
  - **NOTE**: This test encodes the expected behavior - it will validate the fix when it passes after implementation
  - **GOAL**: Surface counterexamples that demonstrate the bug exists
  - **Scoped PBT Approach**: For deterministic bugs, scope the property to the concrete failing case(s) to ensure reproducibility
  - Test that handleUpload function uses setTimeout for delayed navigation when import succeeds (from Fault Condition in design)
  - The test assertions should match the Expected Behavior Properties from design: immediate navigation without intermediate page
  - Run test on UNFIXED code
  - **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Test FAILS (this is correct - it proves the bug exists)
  - Document counterexamples found to understand root cause (setTimeout delay causing flickering)
  - Mark task complete when test is written, run, and failure is documented
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 2. Write preservation property tests (BEFORE implementing fix)
  - **Property 2: Preservation** - 导入失败和其他功能保持不变
  - **IMPORTANT**: Follow observation-first methodology
  - Observe behavior on UNFIXED code for non-buggy inputs (import failures, loading states, cancel operations)
  - Write property-based tests capturing observed behavior patterns from Preservation Requirements
  - Property-based testing generates many test cases for stronger guarantees
  - Run tests on UNFIXED code
  - **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Tests PASS (this confirms baseline behavior to preserve)
  - Mark task complete when tests are written, run, and passing on unfixed code
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Fix for 导入页面直接导航问题

  - [x] 3.1 Implement the fix
    - Remove setTimeout wrapper from router.push call in handleUpload function
    - Change `setTimeout(() => router.push(\`/graph?projectId=${selectedProject}&graphId=${selectedGraph}\`), 2000)` to immediate `router.push(\`/graph?projectId=${selectedProject}&graphId=${selectedGraph}\`)`
    - Optimize state management to avoid intermediate state flickering
    - Preserve warning information handling through URL parameters or sessionStorage if needed
    - Maintain all error handling logic for import failures
    - _Bug_Condition: isBugCondition(input) where input.response.ok === true AND setTimeout is used for navigation_
    - _Expected_Behavior: expectedBehavior(result) - immediate navigation to 3D graph page without intermediate page_
    - _Preservation: Preservation Requirements - import failures, loading states, cancel operations remain unchanged_
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

  - [x] 3.2 Verify bug condition exploration test now passes
    - **Property 1: Expected Behavior** - 导入成功直接跳转
    - **IMPORTANT**: Re-run the SAME test from task 1 - do NOT write a new test
    - The test from task 1 encodes the expected behavior
    - When this test passes, it confirms the expected behavior is satisfied
    - Run bug condition exploration test from step 1
    - **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Test PASSES (confirms bug is fixed)
    - _Requirements: Expected Behavior Properties from design_

  - [x] 3.3 Verify preservation tests still pass
    - **Property 2: Preservation** - 导入失败和其他功能保持不变
    - **IMPORTANT**: Re-run the SAME tests from task 2 - do NOT write new tests
    - Run preservation property tests from step 2
    - **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Tests PASS (confirms no regressions)
    - Confirm all tests still pass after fix (no regressions)

- [x] 4. Checkpoint - Ensure all tests pass
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise.
